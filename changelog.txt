- [FIXED] Added fixes to dynamic weapon list feature to ensure compatibility with DayZ 1.7.7 as well as previous versions.

0.0.9.2 hotfix (DayZ 1.7.7 compatibility):

- [FIXED] Implemented additional compatibility fixes to dynamic weapon list feature.
- [NEW] Namalsk: Added compatibility with Namalsk's selectable loot table feature. DZAI will read from the user-specified loot table instead of the default. 
- [MODIFIED] Namalsk: DZAI will now also read from the HeliCrashNamalsk table instead of HeliCrash.
- [MODIFIED] Added MeleeBaseBallBat and MeleeMachete to AI weapon banlist.
- [MODIFIED] User-specified weapon banlist is now added to the default weapon banlist, instead of the other way around.

0.1.0 Update:

- [NEW] Execution time is now reported into RPT log for DZAI initialization, dynamic weapon list generation, and classname verification.
- [NEW] Overlapping activated dynamic triggers now spawn a reduced number of AI units.
- [REMOVED] Removed M107 and AS50 from preset weapon classname table.
- [MODIFIED] Server no longer waits for DZAI to finish initializing before continuing startup process.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers are generated only after dynamic weapon list and classname verification (if enabled) are completed. This avoids possible cases where AI spawn with invalid items before the weapon list and verification steps are completed.
- [MODIFIED] AI units will now always spawn in an "AWARE" state. When a member if an AI group is killed, the group's state is changed to "COMBAT". When all members of the group have been killed, the group's state will return to "AWARE" with the first respawning unit.
- [MODIFIED] AI units will no longer move with "LIMITED" speed. Possible movement modes are "NORMAL" (move in formation) or "FULL" (move without regard to maintaining formation).
- [MODIFIED] Building positions are now calculated directly instead of using interior positions (less complicated calculations).
- [MODIFIED] AI skill parameters are now more consistent for each weapongrade value. Base values increased, bonus values decreased.
- [MODIFIED] Frequency of dynamic trigger manager script increased to every 3 minutes from 5 minutes.
- [MODIFIED] Increased probabilities of randomizing dynamic trigger location and activation chance.
- [MODIFIED] Delay between each dynamic trigger spawn now fixed at 5 seconds.
- [MODIFIED] Increased probability of generating Military-grade weapons for dynamic AI.

0.1.1 Update:

- [FIXED] Fixed error in dynamic trigger area overlap detection.
- [NEW] Injured AI units now slowly heal themselves in 5% increments.
- [NEW] Dynamic trigger area overlap for dynamic triggers now limited to 10% area overlap (Up to 3 locations are generated per trigger to help ensure that no two triggers overlap).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger activation timings changed to 5/7/20 seconds from 5/10/30 seconds.

0.1.2 Update:

- [NEW] AI spawned from dynamic triggers now seek out the player's position at the time of trigger activation, then begin patrolling the area.
- [NEW] AI groups now actively pursue player responsible for killing a group member for up to 120 seconds if DZAI_findKiller is enabled. AI death will be detected if player is within 250-450m (randomized) of the killed AI. Pursuit distance is randomized between 500-700m of killed AI unit's location.
- [NEW] Dynamic AI now spawn in a "Pursuit" state where they follow the randomly-selected player for a distance of 100m from (calculated from the player's position at time of trigger activation). Player's position is updated every 30 seconds.
- [UPDATED] findKiller feature: Chase distance decreased to 400-600m from 500-700m. Time limit is unchanged.
- [UPDATED] findKiller feature: AI will not pursue players in vehicles, and will exit pursuit state if player enters a vehicle (since AI do not use vehicles).
- [UPDATED] findKiller feature: Player's position is now updated every 15 seconds.
- [UPDATED] Updated preset default classname tables to DayZ 1.7.7.1 version.
- [MODIFIED] Large AI skill parameter increases for AI. Highest-skilled AI may now potentially reach maximum skill levels for all skills except Accuracy and AimingShake.
- [MODIFIED] AI counts are now updated when an AI group is spawned, killed entirely, or despawned.
- [MODIFIED] Increased rate of healing for injured AI from 5% health/15 seconds to 10% health/15 seconds. (rate determined by DZAI_refreshRate)
- [MODIFIED] Temporary NVG feature can only be in effect (if enabled) during night time.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger manager now relocates 25% of existing dynamic triggers every 15 minutes instead of relocating 1 trigger every 3 minutes. (5 triggers/15 minutes for Chernarus).
- [MODIFIED] Classname verification script no longer checks if nonexistant classnames are banned.
- [MODIFIED] AI units revert to an "AWARE" state from "COMBAT" after pursuit state ends if DZAI_findKiller is enabled. If not enabled, AI will remain in "COMBAT" mode until the entire group is killed (this is intended).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers no longer activate for players in Air vehicles. Note: Trigger will activate if players exit the air vehicle, but will not deactivate if players re-enter. AI stop actively tracking targeted player's position but will continue to the last known position.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers now despawn after 120 seconds if all players have left the trigger area, or after 300 seconds after all spawned AI units have been killed (previously, timer was 120 seconds for both conditions).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger intersection warnings now appear in the RPT log if DZAI_debugLevel is set to 1 or higher. (Note: After 3 attempts, triggers are placed on the map regardless of whether or not there is overlapping with other triggers).
- [MODIFIED] Chernarus: dynamic trigger area reduced to 5500m from 6000m, max. triggers reduced to 18 from 19, and trigger moved slightly NW to avoid coastal areas.

0.1.3 Update:

- [FIXED] Fixed active AI counter. Active AI counter is decreased for each AI unit killed, despawned, instead of being updated when the entire group is killed.
- [FIXED] findKiller: Minimum pursuit distance increased from 400m to 500m to better match maximum detection distance (450m).
- [FIXED] Despawn script now checks if the group exists before attempting despawn.
- [REMOVED] Removed unnecessary default pistol classnames tables.

0.1.4 Update:

- [FIXED] Changed the way groups are randomly assigned to a side to prevent null groups from being created.
- [UPDATED] Additional dynamic AI are generated if there are additional players within 100m of targeted player. Previously, all players in the trigger area (600m radius) were counted.
- [MODIFIED] Decreased completion radius of tracking waypoint for dynamic AI from 40m to 30m (AI search accuracy increased).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic AI tracking range increased to 200m from 100m.
- [MODIFIED] Increased Accuracy and AimingShake rating for all AI skill tiers.
- [MODIFIED] Shifted Chernarus center marker further south (encompasses Cherno, but not Elektro).

0.1.5 Update:

- [FIXED] Various fixes and reversions to fix null group creation.

0.1.6 Hotfix:

- [FIXED] Dynamic triggers should not spawn more AI units if they have not despawned previously created units.

0.1.7 Update:

- [NEW] AI units can now be stunned with Tasers. (DZAI will detect if Double Doppler's Taser Mod is installed).
- [NEW] AI units now stop to heal when they reach 75% health. Healing process takes 3 seconds to complete and fully heals the unit, including broken legs. Each AI unit can heal up to 2 times with a 60 second cooldown in between.
- [UPDATED] AI health increased. AI can now take damage equivalent to 12000 units of blood (headshots do 50% additional damage). AI hands modified to be immune from damage (aim cannot be impaired).
- [MODIFIED] Only zombies close to AI group leaders will be marked as hostile, instead of any AI unit.
- [MODIFIED] Combined AI damage reduction factors for bullet/non-bullet damage.
- [MODIFIED] Adjusted AI skill ratings (Accuracy, AimingSpeed decreases).

0.0.1 (Initial release):

- Initial release of DZAI Lite based on DZAI version 0.9.5
- Changes in equipType/weapongrade tiered system are planned.

0.0.2 update:

- [FIXED] Debug markers for patrol waypoints are now properly removed when AI units are despawned.
- [FIXED] Dynamic triggers no longer remain active due to player presence if all AI units in the area have been killed. Despawn process is forced 2 minutes after the last AI unit in the area is killed.
- [REMOVED] Removed fn_getGradeChances.sqf with the removal of the equipType classification system.
- [MODIFIED] DZAI_gradeChances0-3 tables have been simplified into a single DZAI_gradeChances table.

0.0.3 update:

- [NEW] Number of AI spawned per trigger is now dependent on the number of players present in the trigger instead of being configured. (minimum of 2 to maximum of 6, +/- 1)
- [REMOVED] AI no longer carry backpacks.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered chance of generating NVGs in high tier tools table from 25% to 20%.
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger activation timings changed from 5/7/10 seconds to 5/10/15 seconds.

0.0.4 update:

- [FIXED] Removed all remaining variables relating to minimum/additional AI to spawn for dynamic triggers.
- [REMOVED] Dynamic trigger spawning script no longer avoids player positions.
- [MODIFIED] Chernarus: adjusted spawning range of dynamic triggers from 5250m to 6000m. Increased number of dynamic triggers from 20 to 22.
- [MODIFIED] Spawning range of AI from dynamic triggers increased from 125m (+125m max) to 125m (+175m max).
- [MODIFIED] Dynamic trigger activation timings changed from 5/10/15 seconds to 5/10/30 seconds.

0.0.5 update:

- [NEW] Debug markers: Added color-coding for activation state of dynamic triggers. Yellow (Ready Trigger), Green (Awaiting Despawn), Orange (Activated Trigger).
- [NEW] Dynamic triggers now relocate to center around a random player in the trigger area when activated. (Prevents player from quickly leaving the trigger area after entering).
- [MODIFIED] Addition of glanceAt command for AI group leader to help locate player unit.
- [MODIFIED] Modification of dynamic trigger amounts for each map.
- [MODIFIED] Time delay in between each dynamic trigger spawn reduced from 20 seconds to 5 seconds.

0.0.6 update:

- [NEW] Added Dynamic Trigger Mananger to periodically randomize the locations of inactive dynamic triggers. (Default interval: 5 minutes, Relocation probability: 75%).
- [FIXED] Dynamic AI are now properly deleted after death.
- [MODIFIED] fnc_deleteVictim renamed to fnc_updateDead.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered probabilities of generating MilitarySpecial and HeliCrash weapons for AI.
- [MODIFIED] Increased visibility of debug marker for trigger areas marked for despawning.

0.0.7 update:

- [NEW] DZAI now dynamically generates weapon classname tables instead of reading them from a config file. This should greatly improve DZAI's compatibility with all current/future DayZ mods. <b>NOTE</b>: By default, AI may carry any lootable weapon. To "ban" specific weapons from DZAI classname tables, add them to DZAI_banAIWeapons in dzai_variables.sqf. For example, to ban the M107 and AS50: DZAI_banAIWeapons = ["M107_DZ","BAF_AS50_scoped"];
- [FIXED] Fixed undefined variable error in despawning script for dynamic triggers.
- [MODIFIED] Lowered probability of generating NVGs for AI with weapongrade 2-3 from 20% to 15%. 	

0.0.8 update:

- [NEW] Added option to switch between dynamic weapon list generation and preset list for generating AI weapons. By default, dynamic list generation is enabled. Dynamic generation ensures compatibility with all DayZ mods but slightly delays loading of DZAI at server start. Using the preset list is faster, but problems may arise from incompatible classnames.
- [MODIFIED] Re-added preset weapon classname list using weapons from standard DayZ 1.7.6.1.

0.0.9 update:

- [MODIFIED] Dynamic triggers only relocate to a random nearby player's position on activation if the player is not over water (to avoid having a trigger move on top of water). Otherwise, the trigger's position is used as the reference point.
- [MODIFIED] Adjusted spawning distance of dynamic triggers for almost all maps, along with adjustments to spawn amounts to match.
- [MODIFIED] DZAI no longer reads from Supermarket loot tables to collect weapon data since most entries are shared with Residential. This will slightly reduce the amount of time required to collect data.
- [MODIFIED] On startup, debug data now also reports whether or not dynamic weapon list generation is enabled.
